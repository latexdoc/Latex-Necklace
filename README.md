# Latex-Necklace
Latex Necklace with O-Ring

I designed this necklace made from 1.05mm latex from radical rubber. In the BOM list you can find all needed items to draft one by yourself as well as the shopping sources I bought my stuff at. 

I used a drafting program called Valentina (https://valentinaproject.bitbucket.io) which I find it worked quite nicely designing this sort of garments. You are able to just open the project in Valentina and alter it if you want. The neck circumference is based on a variable you can edit using the "open tape" tools. 

In the pictures directory I provide some pictures of the finished work. 

If you have any problems and/or request, feel free to drop me an email at latexdoc@gmx.de.

Finally have fun!

Cheers,
Doc
